What is the classic game Minesweeper?

Minesweeper is a classic logic-based puzzle game where the objective is to clear a rectangular board without detonating any hidden mines. The board consists of covered squares, some of which conceal mines, while others reveal numbers indicating how many mines are adjacent to that square.

By using these numbers as clues, players must logically deduce the locations of the mines and avoid clicking on them. The game is won when all non-mine squares are revealed, and lost if a mine is triggered.

You can choose between three difficulty levels:

Easy: 8x8 grid with 10 mines

Medium: 12x12 grid with 25 mines

Hard: 16x16 grid with 40 mines

Once a game is completed, all victories are saved in the ranking.
The ranking allows you to sort the results by time or date.

You can choose to play the game in either light mode or dark mode.

It is built using vanilla JavaScript (ES5), HTML, and responsive CSS with Flexbox layout.
